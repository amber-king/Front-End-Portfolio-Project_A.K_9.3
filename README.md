Postal Codes also known as zip codes seem to be the last part of an address searched. So, I desgined this webpage to help find zip codes from all over the world via the following API [https://www.zippopotam.us/] 
The user must put in one  or more of the following information to receive valid results:

- city
- state
- country

* If user knows the zip code, they are welcome to type that into the search engine and recieve vaild results.

User will recieve the following information as a result:

- city(place name)
- state
- country
- postal code (zip code)
- country abbreviation
- state abbreviation
- longitude
- latitude
